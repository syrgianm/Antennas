# Antennas
Beamforming and DoA  in Matlab Project in Special Antennas and Antenna Composition ECE AUTH 
An analysis of how work some algorithms from Beamforming and DoA in Smart Antennas
Beamforming Algorithms:
MVDR(Minimum Variance Distortionless Response)
RLS(Recursive Least Squares)
DoA(Directioanal of Arriving) Algorithm:
MUSIC(Multiple Signal Classification)
